**Design hypothesis**

How can I create a game where the scene is composed of a vinyl record player and the user/player who is super tiny must choose a vinyl to load onto the record player, followed by needing to jump a play button to get the music to start playing.

Maybe the little player has to search around a room in order to find vinylâ€™s to then bring to the player. 

**Playtest notes**
