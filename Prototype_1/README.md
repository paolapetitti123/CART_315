**Design hypothesis**

How can I create a game where the scene is composed of a vinyl record player and the user/player who is super tiny must choose a vinyl to load onto the record player, followed by needing to jump a play button to get the music to start playing.

Maybe the little player has to search around a room in order to find vinylâ€™s to then bring to the player. 

**Playtest notes**

Playtester 1: 
- Found the music box
- They didn't think the location of the vinyl player was obvious
- When they did find the vinyl, it was too difficult to get to and they kept clipping through the table
    - Asides from fixing collisions, using more books or being able to push furniture around to act like a step to get onto the coffee table would help.

Playtester 2:
- Didn't think of checking the couch area first, went straight to looking around the kitchen
- Found the vinyl player much quicker than the other player, they said they liekd the sound system 
- Also liked the idea of using a tiny character to move around the place 

Playtester 3:
- Found the perspective of the game to be interesting
- Difficulty finding record player
- Finds the player controls too fast
- Change book locations
- Suggestion: use the objects in the house to hint where the vinyls are, i.e. like a sticky note on the couch the player can see that hints towards where the first vinyl is
- Add collision to front door

Playtester 4:
- Everyne has issues jumping onto the coffee table & record player
- First person to find the glitch with the playhead
- Is exploring the rest of the house, also tries playing the drums in the bedroom
- found the bathroom
- Add clues to find the vinyl (maybe a pop up narrative)

Playtester 5:
- Immediately starts by looking for the record player
- they like the aesthetic 
- player controls too fast
- searching the house
- somehow they managed to glitch into the washing machine
- likes the drums
- Due to the lack of door collisions they fell into the void through the front door
- Suggested giving some kind of visual or auditory queue when the player gets close to a vinyl.

**My Thoughts** 
The playtest session was extremely helpful in conceptualizing ways I could futher expand and explore possibilities in my game if in the future I choose to go with this prototype to continue working on. After the playtest was technically finished and we still had a few minutes on the clock, I let them know that the game come the future will be more of a searching game where the player has to find vinyl records around the house that they can then go to the record player and based off of the vinyls they found they can select a song through a menu that will pop up when the player interacts with the record player. They all seemed to really like this idea and some even thought it could be a little too ambitious but they all gave me some pointers on ways that I could make the search a lot more engaging. 

Moving forward if I select this prototype to continue working on, I will be including the suggestion to make certain furniture items moveable to facilitate the search for the vinyls as well as climbing onto high objects. I will also consider adding in the suggestion to give the player a sort of auditory or visual queue when they get closer to a vinyl they can pick up, maybe like having the vinyl highlight or glow.
